# news-code-dojo
 -  Welcome to this code dojo!
 - The aim is to have fun, work with different people, and explore different approaches to a challenge over the next couple of hours
- You can use whatever language your team decides

### Layout
- 15 minute setup and introduction (refreshments will be available)
- 1 hour coding, ask questions, explore different techniques and try to meet the milestones
- 15 minute wash up, discuss different approaches and demos

### Challenge
- Create a program that generates news headlines

### Key milestones; your program...
- outputs headlines in the command line
- can generate different headlines to those in your dataset
- uses more complex methods to generate it's own headlines
- displays it's headlines as a news article on a webpage
- is creative, tell us about your own milestones in the wash up if you implement any!

### Data sources
- You are free to use whatever you like, you can use an API (e.g. https://newsapi.org/), scrape them from a website, or use the data provided in this repository

### Where is this dojo from?
- A similar code dojo was run at Southampton university in 2014 and I've been told it was a lot of fun!
